### ðŸ‘‹ Hey! I'm [Xentude](https://xentude.dev/)!

## ABOUT ME
I'm Xentude. I work in fields such as a Roblox Game Engineer and a Discord Bot Developer, and I have been in the programming community for about 5 years. A lot of the projects I work on are usually Roleplay/Sci-fi-based, but I am pretty flexible. I have worked with tons of group owners on many different projects, and have gotten close with the Roblox & Discord programming communities quite a lot over the course of the last few years. I started to self-teach myself coding when I was 13 years old, and it has gotten me pretty far. I would have never made a different decision.

## SKILLS
A lot of the programming languages I know/fluent in are in C#, C++, C, JavaScript/TypeScript, Lua/Luau (Roblox), HTML, React, CSS, Swift (Apple), and more. I know a few 3D Modeling skills from my high school courses. I'm quite familiar with Framework/Background creation using IDE's such as JetBrains, Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Rojo and Roblox Studio.
